# Project README

## Captcha Maker

This project involves creating a simple captcha generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Development Process

1. Created index.html, script.js, and style.css files.
2. Designed the HTML structure for displaying the captcha generator and user input fields.
3. Implemented the JavaScript logic to generate a random captcha and validate user input.

### Encountered Errors and Solutions

1. Error: The captcha was not being generated properly, resulting in incorrect user input validation.

   Solution: Implemented a new approach to create the captcha using a combination of alphabets and numbers, ensuring a more stable and reliable captcha generation process.

2. Error: The check function was not properly validating the user input against the generated captcha.

   Solution: Updated the check function to compare the user input with the generated captcha and display the appropriate status message.

3. Error: The CSS styles were not displaying correctly in certain browsers.

   Solution: Revised the CSS styles to ensure cross-browser compatibility and consistent display across different devices.

4. Error: The project was not loading properly due to issues with the file paths of the script.js and style.css files.

   Solution: Updated the file paths in the index.html file to correctly reference the script.js and style.css files.

### Functionality Errors and Fixes

1. Issue: The captcha was not displaying in the input field upon page load.

   Fix: Modified the generate function to populate the generated-captcha input field with the newly created captcha.

2. Issue: The status message was not updating correctly after user input validation.

   Fix: Enhanced the check function to update the status message based on the validation result.

3. Issue: The "Generate New" button was not functioning as expected.

   Fix: Adjusted the generate function to reset the entered-captcha input field and status message upon clicking the "Generate New" button.
